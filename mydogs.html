<p> These are my two dogs Rick and Ivy. Ivy stays at home with my family while I am in Orono, and Rick comes up to school with me. Ivy is a 4 year old border collie and terrier mutt, and Rick is a 7 month old Labrador, Pit-bull terrier, Shepherd mix. Though Rick has a lot of energy for Ivy, they still enjoying running around the yard until the sun goes down!</p>

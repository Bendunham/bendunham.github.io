Snowmobiling</h1>
<hr />
<IMG SRC= "600sdi.JPG">
<p> Though I enjoy a lot of other winter activities such as ice fishing, snowboarding, and hiking, snowmobiling is certainly my most passionate one. Ever since I was 2 years old I have been riding snowmobiles, and have continued to ride with my dad my whole life and will most likely never give it up. My dad and I have made trips all around New England, as well as even venturing into Canada a few times. I have just purchased a new snowmobile this year that I am keeping here at UMaine, and intend on riding another 1200 miles, which would put me around 2000 miles for the season! </p>

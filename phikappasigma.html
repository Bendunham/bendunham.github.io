<p> I am a brother at the Alpha Delta Chapter of Phi Kappa Sigma. After joining my freshman year, first semester, I couldn't see why anyone wouldn't at least consider greek life in their higher education. The amount of life lessons I am going to be able to take away from being part of a fraternity are priceless. We may be just a bunch of college kids, but you are taught responsibility of holding a position, and can take what you have learned and apply it to life later on down the road. I also am glad to have a vast network  of brothers all across the country whom I can count on whenever I need help. I have held positions such as Rush chairman twice, and Social Chair. Those positions were both great with practicing communications with people whom you are not familiar. I hope to one day hold the position of president, as it will give me leadership experience in which I hope to use when I hopefully own my own company </p>

<p> During the summer when I return home to Boxford, I work at ND Landscape in Georgetown, MA. This is one of the largest landscaping companies in the area, with over 80 employees! I work in the construction division of the company, so I get the opportunity to work on projects including new backyards, patios and walkways, and different types of machine work. I was fortunate enough to pass my Hydraulics license test, and am now legally allowed to drive equipment such as excavators, skid-steers, loaders, and cranes. This past summer, I was lucky enough to work on the largest job our company has ever had; a 3 million dollar, front and backyard renovation. I gained so much experience form this job and learned numerous things that I would never have the option to work on at any other company. I have already been offered a job to work in the office prior to my graduation, and plan on working there for a few years after school, and then hopefully starting up my own company.<p>
